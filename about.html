     Hello, my name is Kevin and I am a student at Code Nation in their Fellowship 2020 program. I am a tenth grader at ULCHS and I like to play video games like League of Legends or Genshin Impact. I also like watch any and almost all shows, but I prefer a lot of anime or comedy shows rather than something serious like drama or reality television.
